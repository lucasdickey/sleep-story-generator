Create a square digital illustration for the podcast episode titled "Whispers of the Desert: Amir's Nocturnal Journey." 

### Essential Elements:
- **Main Character**: Amir, an 11-year-old boy with thoughtful eyes, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a tunic the color of desert sand.
- **Companion**: Pasha, a small, wise hedgehog.
- **Setting**: Desert at twilight with rolling dunes, a sky full of stars, and a gentle moonlit atmosphere.

### Visual Style:
- **Aesthetic**: Vintage poster/book cover style.
- **Color Palette**: Muted, warm colors like sunset oranges, deep blues, and soft browns.
- **Design**: Bold line work, flat design with limited shading, and a subtle grain or texture for a retro feel.

### Composition Guidelines:
- **Text**: "KEY TO SLEEP" using BEBAS NEUE font in all caps, centered in the image with extremely large margins (at least 25%).
- **Positioning**: Amir and Pasha should be the focal point, centered in the frame. They could be at the crest of a dune under the starry sky.
- **Mood**: Evoke a sense of peace, serenity, and dreamlike quality. Capture the stillness and gentle wonder of the desert night.

### Atmosphere:
- The illustration should convey tranquility and a connection to nature, with a focus on introspection and calm.

By incorporating these elements and guidelines, create an artwork that aligns with the peaceful and relaxing theme of the podcast episode.
